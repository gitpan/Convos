NAME
    Convos - Multiuser IRC proxy with web interface

VERSION
    0.3002

DESCRIPTION
    Convos is to a multi-user IRC Proxy, that also provides a easy to use
    Web interface. Feature list:

    *   Always online

        The backend server will keep you logged in and logs all the activity
        in your archive.

    *   Archive

        All chats will be logged and indexed, which allow you to search in
        earlier conversations.

    *   Avatars

        The chat contains profile pictures which can be retrieved from
        Facebook or from gravatar.com.

    *   Include external resources

        Links to images and video will be displayed inline. No need to click
        on the link to view the data.

  Running convos
    Convos has sane defaults so after installing Convos you should be able
    to just run it:

      # Install
      $ cpanm Convos
      # Run it
      $ convos backend &
      $ convos daemon

    The above works, but if you have a lot of users you probably want to use
    hypnotoad instead of "daemon":

      $ hypnotoad $(which convos)

    The command above will start a full featured, UNIX optimized, preforking
    non-blocking webserver. Run the same command again, and the webserver
    will hot reload the source code without loosing any connections.

  Configuration
    You can also customize the config by setting "MOJO_CONFIG" before
    running any of the commands above. Example:

      $ MOJO_CONFIG=$HOME/.convos.conf convos daemon

    You can use
    <https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/blob/release/convos.conf> as config
    file template.

  Architecture principles
    *   Keep the JS simple and manageable

    *   Use Redis to manage state / publish subscribe

    *   Archive logs in plain text format, use ack to search them.

    *   Bootstrap-based user interface
